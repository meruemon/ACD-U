# ACD-U

**A Learning Method for learning with noisy labels Using asymmetric Co-teaching with different architectures and Selective Forgetting of Overfitted Noisy Samples**

*Submitted to ELSEVIER Image and Vision Computing*

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **ACD-U**, a novel framework for learning with noisy labels. The proposed method enables post-hoc correction of overfitted noisy samples and efficient learning for trained models by utilizing a selective forgetting mechanism for overfitted noisy samples and an asymmetric co-learning architecture that leverages different learning characteristics between architectures.

## Paper Status

The paper is currently **under review** at *ELSEVIER Image and Vision Computing*.

**Note:**  
As the manuscript is under peer review, the repository is currently in a limited-release state. Some details, including datasets, trained models, and complete documentation, will be provided after the review process concludes.
